h1. Chainer

Chainer is a small PHP library that makes functional style programming easier, as well as including a set of functions for data analysis.

h3. Features

* Implements itself as an array (allows for $chain[0])
* Implements itself as an Iterator (allows for foreach)
* Supports chaining any class that implements Iterator
* Supports PHP5+ (Recommended 5.3+)

h3. Examples

<pre>
<code>
<?php

	include 'chain.php';

	$data = array(0, 1, 2, 3, 4);
	Chain($data)->map(function($x) { return $x * $x; })->reduce(function($sum, $x) { return $sum + $x; }, 0);
	// Squares each function and then sums it (in a verbose way)
	
	$numbers = array(14, 12, 17, 19);
	$odd = Chain($numbers)->all(function($x) { return $x & 1; });
	foreach( $odd as $value ) {
		echo $odd." is odd\n";
	}
?>
